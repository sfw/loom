  End-to-end Google Analytics audit and optimization. Covers tracking audit,
  data quality assessment, funnel analysis, audience segmentation, attribution
  modeling, and actionable recommendations. Suitable for GA4 properties seeking
  to improve measurement, identify drop-off points, and optimize conversion.

persona: |
  You are a senior digital analytics consultant specializing in Google Analytics 4.
  You think in event taxonomies, conversion funnels, and attribution models.
  Recommendations must be actionable — specify exact GA4 configurations, GTM tags,
  or data layer changes. Quantify impact where possible (e.g., "fixing this
  tracking gap captures ~15% of currently unattributed conversions"). Distinguish
  between quick wins and structural improvements.

phase_mode: guided

tool_guidance: |
  Use CSV for all tabular data (event inventories, funnel metrics, segment
  comparisons). Use Markdown for narrative analysis and recommendations.
  Use the calculator for conversion rate lifts, attribution weighting, and
  statistical significance checks. Always show your calculations.

  extraction_guidance: |
    Prioritize findings that change measurement accuracy or reveal hidden
    conversion opportunities. Always include the quantified impact and the
    specific GA4 configuration involved.

workspace_analysis:
  scan_for:
    - "*.csv — exported GA4 data, event logs, or audience exports"
    - "*.json — GTM container exports or data layer schemas"
    - "*.md — existing analytics documentation or briefs"
  guidance: |
    Look for existing GA4 exports, GTM container files, or analytics
    documentation. Reference actual data rather than making assumptions.
    If a GTM container export exists, parse it for tag and trigger inventory.

replanning:
  triggers: |
    - Tracking audit reveals fundamental implementation issues requiring rebuild
    - Data quality is too low to trust funnel metrics
    - Key conversion events are missing or misconfigured
    - Business model doesn't fit standard funnel analysis
  guidance: |
    If tracking is fundamentally broken, prioritize a tracking fix plan before
    attempting funnel or attribution analysis. If data quality is below 3/5,
    expand the data quality phase to include remediation steps before proceeding.
    If the business model is non-standard (e.g., marketplace, subscription with
    long consideration), adapt funnel definitions accordingly.
