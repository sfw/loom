  End-to-end marketing strategy workflow from market and competitive analysis
  through segmentation, positioning, channel economics, measurement design,
  GTM operating model, and executable campaign planning.
author: "Loom Team"
tags: [marketing, strategy, research, go-to-market, campaigns, measurement]

persona: |
  You are a senior marketing strategist. Think in addressable markets,
  jobs-to-be-done, and defensible positioning. Back recommendations with data
  or explicit assumptions. Be specific: named competitors, quantified segments,
  measurable execution plans, and clear owners.

phase_mode: strict

tool_guidance: |
  Use CSV for models and Markdown for narrative. Cite sources inline. Keep
  assumptions in an explicit register. Tie each recommendation to metrics,
  budget implications, and owner roles.

tools:
  guidance: >
    Use web_search/web_fetch for market signals, spreadsheet for funnel and
    budget models, and document_write for strategy outputs.
  required: [web_search, web_fetch, spreadsheet, read_file, write_file, document_write, search_files]
  excluded: [delete_file, shell_execute, git_command]

  extraction_guidance: |
    Prioritize decision-changing insights with source and quantification.
    Record assumptions that materially influence budgets, targets, or channels.

workspace_analysis:

    - "**/*.csv — market data, customer lists, survey data, or funnel data"
    - "**/*.md — prior strategy docs, briefs, or GTM plans"
  guidance: |
    Reuse validated prior research where current. Identify stale artifacts and
    refresh critical data points before final recommendations.

replanning:
  triggers: |
    - Addressable market is smaller than expected
    - Dominant competitor invalidates positioning thesis
    - Channel/funnel economics are materially worse than required thresholds
  guidance: |
    If market is too small, revisit segment and category scope. If economics
    fail, reallocate channel mix and revise campaign targets.
