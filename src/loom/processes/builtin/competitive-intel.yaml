  Quick competitive intelligence gathering and comparison. Three lightweight
  phases for identifying competitors, researching their offerings, and
  building a structured comparison. Designed for fast ad-hoc requests
  when a full marketing strategy is unnecessary.
author: "Loom Team"
tags: [competitive, intelligence, research, comparison, quick]

persona: |
  You are a competitive intelligence analyst who works fast and focuses on
  actionable differences. You care about what competitors actually do, not
  what they claim. You look for pricing pages, job postings, product
  changelogs, and customer reviews as signal sources.

phase_mode: suggestive

tool_guidance: |
  Favor structured comparison tables over narrative. Use CSV for the final
  comparison matrix so it can be imported into other tools. Keep narrative
  sections concise — bullet points over paragraphs. When a data point is
  uncertain, mark it with a tilde (~) prefix and note the source.

phases:
  - id: identify-competitors
    description: >
      Build the initial competitor list. Include direct competitors (same
      product category), indirect competitors (different approach to same
      problem), and emerging threats. Categorize each by type and relevance.
    depends_on: []
    model_tier: 1
    verification_tier: 1
    acceptance_criteria: >
      At least 5 competitors identified. Each has a name, website, one-line
      description, competitor type (direct/indirect/emerging), and estimated
      relevance (high/medium/low). The list is prioritized.
    deliverables:
      - "competitor-list.csv — identified competitors with categorization"

  - id: research-competitors
    description: >
      For each high-relevance competitor, gather: product capabilities,
      pricing model, target customer, recent funding or revenue signals,
      stated strategy, key hires, and notable customer wins or losses.
    depends_on: [identify-competitors]
    model_tier: 2
    verification_tier: 1
    acceptance_criteria: >
      Each high-relevance competitor has a profile covering at least 5 of
      the 7 research dimensions. Data sources are noted. Recency of
      information is stated (e.g., pricing as of Q3 2025).
    deliverables:
      - "competitor-profiles.md — detailed profiles of top competitors"

  - id: build-comparison
    description: >
      Create a structured comparison matrix across key dimensions. Identify
      where the subject company is stronger, weaker, or at parity. Highlight
      the top 3 competitive advantages and top 3 vulnerabilities.
    depends_on: [research-competitors]
    model_tier: 2
    verification_tier: 2
    acceptance_criteria: >
      Comparison matrix has at least 8 dimensions (features, pricing,
      integrations, support, market position, etc.). Strengths and
      weaknesses are specific and supported by evidence from profiles.
      A summary table shows win/lose/parity per competitor per dimension.
    deliverables:
      - "comparison-matrix.csv — feature and capability comparison grid"
      - "competitive-summary.md — key advantages, vulnerabilities, and recommendations"

        Review each strength and weakness claim. It must reference a
        specific feature, pricing data point, customer review, job posting,
        or other observable signal. Reject claims based solely on brand
        perception or unsupported assumptions.

      description: "Key facts about a competitor — product, pricing, positioning, recent moves"
    - type: competitive_gap
      description: "A specific dimension where the subject company is weaker or stronger"
  extraction_guidance: |
    Focus on facts that would influence product or sales strategy. Always
    include the competitor name and the date or recency of the information.
    For gaps, note whether the gap is widening or narrowing.

workspace_analysis:
  scan_for:
    - "*.csv — existing competitor data or feature matrices"
    - "*.md — prior competitive analyses or battle cards"
  guidance: |
    If prior competitor research exists, use it as a starting point and
    focus on updating stale data points rather than rebuilding from scratch.
    Look for sales battle cards that may contain validated competitive
    positioning.

replanning:
  triggers: |
    - The competitive landscape is too fragmented to compare meaningfully
    - A key competitor has been acquired or shut down during research
    - The subject company's own product scope is unclear
  guidance: |
    If there are too many competitors, narrow to the top 5 by relevance
    and note the long tail. If the subject company's product is unclear,
    add a preliminary scoping step before competitor identification.
